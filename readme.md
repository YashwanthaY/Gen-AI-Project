## 📌 About

I successfully completed a **2-Day Applied Generative AI Engineering Bootcamp** where I built multiple real-world AI modules using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agent-based architecture.

This repository contains all the modules and implementations developed during the workshop.
